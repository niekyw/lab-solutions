# Teacher Guide: Python | Review Session

## SWBATs
- Review what you have learned in python:
    - **Lists**
    - **Dictionaries**
    - **Functions** 

## Motivation
- Youâ€™re going to be pushed in Y2, to the best version of yourself!
- We'll be setting our consistent class culture, "Learning to Learn" is as important as learning the material itself!
- We will always support each other, and have each other's backs! We're a learning team.


## Lesson Plan
- **Slides 3-4:** Basic Python:
    - Kahoot!
    - For Instructors: Through the kahoot answers, try to **identify and map** out the students strengths & weaknesses in python, so you would structure an effective session based on that.
    - After the kahoot: take the time to review basic python concepts, before moving on to the rest.

- **Slides 5-8: Lists Review**
	- **Slide 6:** A list is a colletion of variables, and it can be different types of variables. ask the students what types can we store.
	- **Slide 7:** 
		- Indexing is basically the way to **navigate** through a list, each index points to a specific variable in the list. we start from 0 and after each one the index adds 1.
		- Indexes are like english from left to right, but when we add a minus it's like arabic/hebrew from right to left.
	- **Slide 8:**
		- `.append(Value)` - adds a value to the list at the end (if the last index is 2 it adds it at index 3).
		- `.remove(Value)` - removes a value from the list, and reorganizes the indexes accordingly.
		- `len(list)` - returns the length of the list.


- **Slides 9-13: Dictionaries**
	- **Slide 10:** 
		- a dictionary is unordered collection of data, which means the data doesn't have a specific location in the dictionary, instead we have pairs of keys & values. using the key we retrieve the value.
		- A python `dictionary` is very similar to a `list`, but has some different syntax.
		- The keys in the dictionary have to be unique!! (ask the students if capital letters make a key different or not)
	- **Slide 11:** A python dictionary has `key` and `value` pairs, the key points to the value.
	- **Slide 12:** 
		- To print the `key`'s `value` we say - `print(dict1["key"])`, we write the name of the dictionary and in `[]` we write the key
		- To edit the value of a key in the dictionary - `dict1["Key"] = "newValue
		- To add a pair to the dictionary - `dict1["newKey"] = "newValue"`
	- **Slide 13:** To check if a key exists in a dictionary we write - `if "key" in dictionary"`.


- **Slides 14-17: Functions**
	- **Slide 15:** A function is a block of code, that is organized and reusable, this block might take inputs or not, and it's supposed to do a task according to what it was written for.
	- **Slide 16:** Point out to the students the 6 things they need to be able to create a function (make it engaging!!).
	- **Slide 17:** Go over the function item by item according to the animations.

- **Slide 15: Lab time!**
    - Send students to lab time.
- At the end of session, draw students' attention back to the lecture, discuss our **Takeaways**, and leave them with a **cliffhanger** in the "Next session" slide!
- ![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) Don't forget to collect everyone's microFeedback before letting students out of class!




## Conclusions/Takeaways  
- Python is a powerful, easy to read, high-level programming language.
- OOP is an approach of solving programming problems by creating classes and objects!  
- You will be using Python this summer to build whole complete web applications!
