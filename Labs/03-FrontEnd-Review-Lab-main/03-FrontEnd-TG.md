# Teacher Guide: Front-End | Review Session

## SWBATs
- Review what you have learned in the yearlong (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
    - **HTML**:
        - Review basic structure of HTML files.
        - Remember all the different HTML tags we can use.
    - **CSS**:
        - Review basic format of how CSS is written and used.
        - Remember the ways we can *link* a `CSS` file to an `HTML`.
        - Review `class` and `id` CSS selectors.
    - **JS**:
        - Review basic format of how JS is written and used.
        - Review JS functions.
        - Remember the ways we can *link* a `JS` file to an `HTML`.
        - Review `DOM` (**D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel)

## Motivation
- Youâ€™re going to be pushed in Y2, to the best version of yourself!
- We'll be setting our consistent class culture, "Learning to Learn" is as important as learning the material itself!
- We will always support each other, and have each other's backs! We're a learning team.


## Lesson Plan
- After every review:  
    - Make sure to actively demo and apply the code you're displaying to show students how it's done in action.
    - Don't forget to take a temperature check!  
    
   
- **Slides 5-9: HTML Review**

- ![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) Don't forget to collect everyone's microFeedback before letting students out of class!




## Conclusions/Takeaways  
- HTML is used to manage the content in a web page!
- By combining CSS and JS with HTML, you can have interactive, nicely designed websites!
- DOM allows you to have control over any element in your HTML page.


## Hints & Hurdles
- DOM is usually a confusing topic for students, treat it delicately, and try to stick to only few main commands for them to remember:
    - `document.getElementById(id)`
    - `element.attribute = new value`
- Also tell students they will have access to this, so they don't need to memorize it all.
